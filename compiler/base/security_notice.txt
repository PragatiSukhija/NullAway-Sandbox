# Hello, and thanks for looking into the Java Playground's security!
#
# This build is running on an unprivileged, sandboxed Docker container with no
# network access, so while you can technically run arbitrary code on the
# Playground you shouldn't be able to do any damage with it.
#
# Nothing is perfect though: if you find a way to escape the sandbox, please
# disclose it. Since this is a fork of the rust playground and any issues you
# found probably exist there too, you should report it to them following their
# security policy. in You can find the policy at:
#
#    https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/security
#
# Also inform one of us if you can
