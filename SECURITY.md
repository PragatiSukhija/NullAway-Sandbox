This is a fork of The Rust Playground. You can report security issues
to me at `ethan@mccue.dev`, but chances are if we have an issue they have the same one too.
So report to them as well if it is important.

The Rust Playground follows the same security reporting procedures as
the main Rust organization. If you have found a vulnerability in the
Playground, please report it according to [the Rust security
policy][policy]. Thanks!
